## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on scraping and analyzing information from websites. The project is designed to showcase my data analysis skills and is part of my portfolio as data analyst student.

## Project Description

### 1. Data Collection

- The code in this repository includes web scraping scripts using Python, BeautifulSoup, and requests library to extract information.


### 2. Data Processing

- The extracted data is processed and cleaned in Python to create a structured dataset for analysis.

### 3. Data Analysis

- The data is analyzed to derive insights or answer specific questions related to the data.

## Repository Contents

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data collection, processing, and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required for the project.
- `data/`: A directory to store the scraped data.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/imjoseba/web-scrapping-playground.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `data_analysis.ipynb` to explore the code and analysis.

## Results

- The spanish-actors notebook can help understand the demographics and biographical information of actors born in Spain.

# Spanish Actors COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for web scraping and analyzing COVID-19 data related to Spanish actors. The code fetches data from a webpage that lists countries where coronavirus has spread and extracts relevant information for further analysis.

## Code Description

The code is organized into several sections:

1. **Data Collection and Parsing**: We use libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse data from a webpage that contains information about countries affected by COVID-19.

2. **Data Processing**: The code extracts data for each country, including the number of cases, deaths, and the continent.

3. **Data Analysis**: The extracted data is sorted and formatted into a text table for easier visualization.

4. **Pandas DataFrame**: The formatted data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for potential further analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spanish-actors-covid-analysis.git`
2. Install the required Python libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Python script to execute the code.

## COVID-19 Data

The code extracts data related to COVID-19 cases and deaths for various countries.
