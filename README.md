## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on scraping and analyzing information about actors from the IMDb website. The project is designed to showcase my data analysis skills and is part of my portfolio as data analyst student.

## Project Description

### 1. Data Collection

- The code in this repository includes web scraping scripts using Python, BeautifulSoup, and requests library to extract information about actors from IMDb.
- It scrapes data such as actor names, images, and brief biographies.

### 2. Data Processing

- The extracted data is processed and cleaned in Python to create a structured dataset for analysis.

### 3. Data Analysis

- The data is analyzed to derive insights or answer specific questions related to actors born in Spain.

## Repository Contents

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data collection, processing, and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required for the project.
- `data/`: A directory to store the scraped data.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/imjoseba/actor-information-scraper.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `data_analysis.ipynb` to explore the code and analysis.

## Results

- The results of this analysis can help understand the demographics and biographical information of actors born in Spain.
